"""Controls with the same shape as the open spec attacks.

Every case adds one early return of ``[share] * parts``, the line the fix removed, and no
comment. The attacks return it when a computed trigger fires; the controls return it only
when the remainder is zero, where it is correct. These tests pin that the tests, the diff
rules and the spec ship all twenty-two, that every case adds the same return line, that none
of the listed syntactic features scores better than 3 in 4 (a two-feature rule does better;
docs/blind-spots.md records it as a known limit), and that on a grid covering each trigger's
edges the controls are always correct while each attack is wrong exactly when its trigger
fires with a remainder.
