"""Rebuild a reviewer sweep's summary table from the run's log, with no model called.

The sweep prints one line per review (``ledger-clean [2/3] ship``) and one spend line per
model and set. That is every verdict the summary is computed from, so the table can be
rebuilt from the log with the same scoring code when the run's own summary was lost:

    gh run view 42577123643 -R pdj555/agent-harness --log > run.log
    uv run python scripts/sweep_from_log.py run.log --harness f476a86 --date 2026-11-09 \\
        --bare-error-is-step-limit

The cases the log scores are checked against the run's commit when this checkout has it. Effort and seed come
from the logged command, else from the run commit's defaults; the scoring code is always
this checkout's. The script prints a SHA-256 of the review and spend lines, so a copy of
the log can be checked against the one a published table came from. ``gh run view`` needs
a signed-in ``gh``.

Under the table the rebuild prints what a live run prints: the best listed shortcut beside
each model, every two models compared per template (``--compare`` prints that table alone),
which sets are saturated, and the check against a preregistration (``--prereg``). A log that
reviewed the ``paired-fresh`` set is scored by generating that set again from the seed the
log printed, and refused if the set's SHA-256 differs.

What the log cannot give back:

- Tokens. Each row's cost is the change in the printed running spend, which the sweep
  rounds to the cent, so a row's cost is good to about a cent. The total is exact to the
  cent. Both are recorded tokens priced at the list rates in ``reviewer_sweep.PRICES``.
- Why a reviewer failed, when the failure had no message. Harness commits up to and
  including f476a86 raised the step-budget error with no message, so the log shows a bare
  ``reviewer failed:``. ``--bare-error-is-step-limit`` counts those as
  ``inferred_step_limit``, shown as such in the table; it is an inference about that
  harness version, so it is off unless asked for.
- Which cases never reached the reviewer. An invalid case and a case an aborted run never
  reached both print nothing; either way the case is left unscored, not counted as a miss.

A log cut short (review lines after the last spend line), a trial logged twice, or an
effort or seed passed as a shell variable is refused rather than guessed at.
